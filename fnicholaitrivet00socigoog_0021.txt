is es follows, ‘Ci comenoent. les Cronicles de
Frere Nichol Trivet, escrit a ma dame Marie,
la fillie mon Seignen'r le Rei d’Engleterre, le
filtz Henri.’ ¹ It begins with Genesis, and oon-

of Edward I., and ‘lupostil lohan' vincismie

Dominio ;² but whether the Latin or the French
had the precedenoe in composition, we cannot
determine. There is, however, a presumption
in favour of the Norman·Freuoh version, from
