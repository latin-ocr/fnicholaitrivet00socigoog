is appended hy Hall to his edition, and hy him

intituled the Continuation of Trivet. This
name is very apt to mislead. The work treats,
indeed, of the history of the successoros Ed-
ward 1.; but its compilor, besides being known
by others as the anonymous Continuator of Mat·
thew of Paris, is, in the style, arrangement, and,
we may add, quality, different from, and so in·
ferior to our author, that it has been judged
adrisable to give the Annals of Trivet entire,
and to reserve the other anonymous work for
another occasion, when it may be more appro
priately included among the numerous short,
and, in three instaures, anonymous chroniclers
of the reign of Edward ΙΙ.

§a In conclusion, all that now remains for conclusion.
the Editor, is, the grateful taslr of alluding to
the advantages received hy this edition in its
passing through the press of Messrs. Bentley
and Co. To them he has to express. his* ohli-
gation ; bnt in a particular manner to the learn-
ed person who superintends their reading depart-
ment. Few know what labour and minuteness
are required where so many MSS. have hoen
consulted, and to this Gentleman the Editor is

‚ indebted not only sor his patient industry and

ι acutenesS, but also sor some valuahle readings
when it has been judged expedient to amend
the text.
