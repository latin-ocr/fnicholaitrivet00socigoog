for where he has occasion to extract from other
authors, orto give insertion t‘o state documents,
his truthlulness and accuracy are proved by the
t'aot that these, with the exceptiones an occa·
sional clerical error, are often nearer to original
contemporary MSS. than those which appear in
the great collections ol Wilkins or Rymer. His
style is smooth, clear, and agreeahle3 some-
times highly graphic in describing stirring- in·
cidentS, and often not inelegant. Nor is this
to be wondered at; lor, besides ¹composing comss
mentaries on some ol the early Fathers, he has

mus, and the two Senecas ι ’

As an historiar, he rs always judieiouS, and 11¹· 0:301:
never violent In relating the misdeeds of King hlhffin
John, both m his brother Richard' s reign and m
his own, he rs contented with stating the simple
facts as they occurred, iu a straightforward
manner, ahstaining from all ,vituperation3 and
what is deserving of blame in Edward Ι. he

monarch had not been his contemporary sove-

from the wholesale plagiarism of Walsingham,
whose Reign of Edward Ι. is taken, word for
word, from our author, with the exception of a
Meteorological Summary of each year, which he
seems very often to have horrowed from the
Chronicle of Dunstable, and of occasional inter·
polations, which bear the evident stamp of a
much later age. For this reason Walsingham
must be read with caution3 for though his inter·
polations in the portion he has appropriated
from Trivet are not many, and comparatively
unimportant, it is not so in succeeding reigns,
