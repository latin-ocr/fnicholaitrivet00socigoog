stead of being a joint commentary, the first ten
books are ,all that Valeys wrote, and the re»

of st. Augustino. The printed editions begin,
‘Fluminis impetus laetificat civitatem Dn1,’ cto.
as a profane, which may possibly be Trivet’s.
The commentary of Valeys begins, ‘In isto
primo contangit B. Augustinus duas culpas Ro=
manorum,' eto.; whereas that of Trivet, which
we have complete in the MS. Her. 4093, begins,
‘Gloriosa dicta sunt do te, civitas Dn1. Cum
Romani alia Gothorum irruptione affligeren-

ed. 1473, Valeys ends ‘Tunc enim erat Por-
phyrius in rebus humanis' etc.-‘ fuit enim ut
