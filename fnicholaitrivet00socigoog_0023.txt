3. As we do not profess to give a catalogueo m· mom
of our author's writings, we should have con- ”dham
tented ourselves with these examples, were it
not that we feel called upon to allude to the
’ versatility of his talents, as shown in the many
commentarios which he made on the Classics,
and in proof of the paine he took to acquire
the necessary historieal knowledge to elucidate
his author. Thus, we find ascribed to him com·
mentories on Livy, Juvenal, the Metamorphoses
of Ovid, Seneca, Valerius Maximus, and Boe·
thius. To speak of these in detail is foreign
from our purpose3 but, in proof of his unwea- .
ried diligence in collecting facts, as well as
giving an indirect testimony in favour of the ,
pains he took to arrive at historical truth, we
cannot forbear quoting the commencement of
his commentary on Boethius. After saying, me
that, before he proceeds to his comment on then.. ”nil ⁰¹¹
philosophy of Boethius, it would be necessary, rhoffi*
for rendering his author intelligible, to refer
to the history of the period ιιι question, he
thus continues: ‘Historiam Theoderici regis
Gothorum ex diversis Cronicis collectam censui

praelibandum. Ipsa namque diligentius in-
specta, apparebunt memoria et commemoratione
digna, nec non intentioni nostrae subservientia,
videlicet quo tempore iste auctor illustris ilo
ruit, qua occasione libros istos conscripsit, snb
quo persecutore, ac quibus meritis, praesenti so-
